### WORLD WEATHER

This is a weather application that uses PySimpleGUI and the Weatherstack API to display weather data. When the user inputs a location and clicks "Search", the application sends a request to the API to get the weather data for that location. Then, the application displays the weather data in a GUI.

The application first defines a dictionary that maps weather conditions to icons, and a function **convert\_12\_to\_24** to convert the time from a 12-hour format to a 24-hour format.

*   The function **get\_weather\_data** makes a request to the Weatherstack API using the **requests** library and extracts the relevant data from the JSON response. The function returns a tuple of weather data.
*   The function **create\_window** defines the layout of the GUI using PySimpleGUI elements. The layout includes an input field for the location, a button to trigger the search, and several columns to display the weather data. The function returns a PySimpleGUI **Window** object.
*   The program then creates a PySimpleGUI window using the **create\_window** function and enters a loop that reads events from the window until the user closes the window. If the user clicks the "Search" button, the program calls the **get\_weather\_data** function with the location input and updates the GUI with the weather data.

Overall, this is a simple but effective weather application that demonstrates the use of PySimpleGUI and APIs in Python.
